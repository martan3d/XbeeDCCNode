# XbeeProtothrottle Development

### This is a place holder. Commercial development is in private repositories.

#### I have 55 repositories marked as private, however most of them are very obsolete.
#### These remain active, plus the public ones pinned to my front page:
###### - Protothrottle Receiver with Physics and PWM (C) Atmega328 and 168 versions
###### - Protothrottle Receiver Programmer for Windows (Python/WX)
###### - Protothrottle Recevier Programmer for Android with GOT cable (Android/Java)
