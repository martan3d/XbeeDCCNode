## This is a place holder. Current development is in private repositories. Sorry about that scavengers.

#### I have 55 repositories marked as private, however most of them are obsolete.
#### These remain:
###### - Protothrottle Receiver with Physics (C)
###### - Protothrottle Receiver Programmer Web App (Python/Apache2)
###### - AirRx for the Airwire Receiver (C)
###### - Ansible scripts for assembling the Programmer (Ansible)
###### - Android Bluetooth App for Xbee3 (Android Studio)
