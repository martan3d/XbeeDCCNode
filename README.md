# XbeeDCCNode

### This is a place holder for now. Current development is in private repositories. Once finalized, these will be built into binary Atmel C compatible libraries. 

These services, mostly IRQ handlers, will constitute the 'operating system' for the control node while exposing the xbee message protocol and structure for controlling the node.

Each node consists of 4 servo outputs, a Digital Output for a direction relay, a DCC logic level output and a PWM output. These will fit in the reduced footprint of the Nano module. 

Additional features are supported by the full sized widget board. In addition to the base features mentioned above, the full sized board will support digital I/O Analog inputs and a full duplex serial port.
